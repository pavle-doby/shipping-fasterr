## My Process for creating Shipping Faster

### Create Monorepo

- [x] Create a new repo on GitHub

### Add backed and frontend folders

- [x] Add backend folder with simple [Hono](https://hono.dev/) server
- [x] Add frontend (universal) folder using `npm create tamagui@latest` more info [tamagui](https://tamagui.dev/)

### Setup frontend project

- [x] Use app router for next.js (delete pages router stuff)
- [x] Setup tokens for tamagui that are based on [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [ ] Setup custom themes (light and dark?) for tamagui
